Multi-agent systems (MAS) are decentralized frameworks where autonomous agents interact and collaborate to solve complex problems. 
In the context of smart grids, MAS enables dynamic coordination between distributed energy resources (DERs), consumers, and grid operators. 
Reinforcement learning (RL) further augments MAS capabilities by allowing agents to learn optimal policies through interactions with their environment. 
This chapter explores the theoretical foundation of MAS, its architectural components, and the applicability of RL in enhancing grid intelligence.
